# Cataract Detection Using Supervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **early detection of cataracts** using **supervised machine learning techniques** applied to retinal eye images. Cataracts are one of the leading causes of visual impairment, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss.

The system uses **image preprocessing**, **feature extraction**, and **classification models** to distinguish between normal and cataract-affected images.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To preprocess retinal images for noise reduction and enhancement  
- To extract meaningful texture features using **GLCM**
- To train and evaluate multiple supervised ML models
- To compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics
- To support early-stage cataract detection through automation

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Dataset Collection**
   - Retinal eye images (normal & cataract)

2. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Grayscale conversion  
   - Noise removal  
   - Image normalization  

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
   - Features such as contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity

4. **Machine Learning Models Used**
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Results
- The models were evaluated and compared based on performance metrics
- The best-performing model achieved **~86% accuracy**
- Results indicate that ML-based approaches are effective for early cataract detection

## 🌐 Web Interface – Cataract Detection System

A user-friendly web interface was developed to allow users to upload retinal images and receive real-time cataract classification results. The system predicts whether the uploaded image is **Normal** or **Cataract** using trained supervised machine learning models.
